    <div id="tribute-info">
      <p>Puneeth Rajkumar (1975–2021), fondly known as Appu, was a celebrated Indian actor, playback singer, television presenter, and philanthropist who worked primarily in Kannada cinema. The youngest son of Kannada cinema icon Dr. Rajkumar, Puneeth entered the film industry as a child artist and went on to become one of the most loved and versatile actors of his generation.</p>
      
      <p>He starred in numerous blockbuster films like *Appu*, *Power*, *Arasu*, *Jackie*, *Raajakumara*, and *Yuvarathnaa*. Known for his energy, dance moves, and screen presence, he was rightfully called the "Power Star" by his fans. His contribution to Kannada cinema earned him several accolades including National and State Film Awards.</p>

      <p>Off-screen, Puneeth was a remarkable human being. He donated generously to educational and healthcare causes and quietly supported hundreds of students and underprivileged families. His sudden demise at the age of 46 due to cardiac arrest left a huge void in the hearts of millions.</p>

      <p>Even in death, Puneeth continued his noble deeds by donating his eyes — just like his father. His legacy of kindness, humility, and excellence will always be remembered.</p>
